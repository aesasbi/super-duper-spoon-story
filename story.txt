She was walking down the street when she bumped into a tree. What a ditzy girl, all she does is stare at her fun. Doesn't help that she didn't wear her prescription glasses that day.

The very next day she was walking down the street again and ran into a person. The person yelled at her for not watching out for where she was going.
 She decided to begin wearing her glasses that day. 


But her glasses suddenly came alive! "ahhh!" she screamed. Those weren't glasses, it was a snake! She grabbed the snake and threw it to the ground. Dazed and confused, the snake looked up at her and said "excuse me! why did you do that?" 

The snake explained that he was a time travelor from a different universe and that in that universe, snakes are used as glasses.

She laughed, looking like she's unveiling some big plan, "I found you, buddy!" She exclaimed, "I am also from universe X!

"Dang! You are!? I've been looking for people like me!" exclaimed the snake. In shock and in surprise, the girl and snake 
shared a warm embraced. No matter how far you are, even at the ends of the universe, you will always find your people.
